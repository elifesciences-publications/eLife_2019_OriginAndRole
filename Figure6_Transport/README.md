Datasets associated with « Origin of the bidirectionality of cerebrospinal fluid flow and impact on long-range transport between brain and spinal cord”, Thouvenin and Keiser et al., submitted to eLife in 2019.


Analysis of long-range transport- Theoretical curve and transport plot.

1)	The dataset corresponding to figure 6 C1 has been obtained by numerical simulations performed with Comsol. The associated datapoints can be found in *****

2)	The theoretical curve in figure 6 C2 can be generated with ‘PlotTransportTAylorArris.m’
3)	The data corresponding to figure 6 D can be found in ‘Transport.mat’, where two matrices can be found: Trs2 and Time3. Trs2(1, : ) is the distance measured from the begining of central canal. Trs2(2, : ) is the group of the measurement. The corresponding figure can be plotted with ‘GenerateTransportPlot.m’
