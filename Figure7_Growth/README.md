Datasets associated with « Origin of the bidirectionality of cerebrospinal fluid flow and impact on long-range transport between brain and spinal cord”, Thouvenin and Keiser et al., submitted to eLife in 2019.

Measurements of embryo length and angle 30 hours post ablation.


1)	In the 30hpa folder, the macroscope images of the embryos are shared. The images starting from 1 to 4 correspond to the funnel ablation condition. The images from 5 to 8 correspond to a smoother funnel ablation condition we finally did not mention in the article, and did not share here. The images from 9 to 12 correspond to the control (yolk extension) ablation condition. The images starting from C correspond to the no ablation condition. 

2)	The growth.mat dataset shows the length and angle for all 3 conditions, with the corresponding X in the first row, and length or angle in the second row.

3)	The “PlotGrowth_PlusStat.m” opens the previous dataset, and plot it similarly to figure 7. A t-test is also computed similarly to this figure.
